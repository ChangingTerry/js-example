#JavaScript Framework Comparison

This repo is an attempt to look at different JavaScript frameworks can be used to build a simple single page app

##Frameworks
- Plain old [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- MVC Style by [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
- All the bells and whistles and testing with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)

````
npm install
````
Followed by
````
node server.js

And a test server will launch on ````http://localhost:8080```` using the ````/www```` directory as your webroot
